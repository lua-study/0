## Description

Civitas is a free-to-play strategy empire-building browser game written in Javascript with the help of the [jQuery library](https://jquery.org/). Players develop and maintain their settlement from initial village to a fully grown metropolis, influencing and conquering the neighbouring settlements.

There is no set goal, game is played on an infinite-round basis and there is a server component planned. The focus of the game is to manufacture and trade resources in order to raise the level of your city.

 

## Features

- [x] Over 80 types of buildings, each intertwined in the chain of production.
- [x] Custom climate zones, each with specific buildings.
- [x] Global market, player can trade goods with other settlements.
- [x] Army! Navy! Soldiers! Ships!
- [x] Fame system that allows your city to level up via trades, conquers and special buildings.
- [x] Prestige system that affects diplomacy.
- [x] Each city in the game world is linked via an influence system that needs to be maintained for diplomacy to work.
- [x] Random events that can change your diplomacy status with the other cities, give you coins or random resources.
- [x] Espionage, influence cities, destroy buildings, sabotage.
- [x] Ranking screen, where cities get ranked according to their status in the world.
- [x] Declare war, propose alliances and pacts, ask other settlements to join your city, propose cease fire.
- [ ] Heroes, unique classes and items, attributes.
- [ ] Server component, no actual data is saved externally, only in your browser's localStorage.
- [ ] Jailer component that assures game data integrity (no cheating).
- [ ] Any player interaction since no data is transmitted to the server component.
- [ ] Artificial Intelligence (AI) for computer-controlled cities.

## Playing

In development, Civitas is using several assets that are copyrighted by [Bluebyte](https://www.bluebyte.com), so I cannot redistribute them with the game. In the future, the game will have a brand new set of graphics but for now those will be enough for testing. You can find a link to the said assets [in this Gitee](https://gitee.com/sizeofcat/civitas/issues/IZBLB) or [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/sizeofcat/civitas/issues/1#issuecomment-513243623). All the other game resources are freely distributed under the GPLv3 license, same as the code.


### 1. With Docker

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

And point your browser to `http://localhost` (or even better, add the line below to your `/etc/hosts` file and browse `http://civitas.test`.

```
127.0.0.1	civitas.test
```

### 2. Local

Choose an archive format from below, download and uncompress it. Point your browser to `dist/index.html`, you don't need a game server to play.

## Development

Start by installing all the prerequisites:

```
$ npm install
```

Run the main script that will load gulp and proxy the requests from `civitas.test` to `localhost:3000`.

```
$ npm start
```
